# NFT Sales X Bot ü§ñ

This was made to succeed my [Opensea Sales X Bot](https://github.com/dsgriffin/opensea-sales-x-bot) repo; while relying on the OpenSea Events API is simpler, it doesn't include any NFT sales happening in other, newer marketplaces.

So, we need to monitor & process Ethereum event logs for ERC-721 token transactions directly, before posting any sales to X.

Currently, `Opensea`, `Blur`, `LooksRare` & `X2Y2` are supported.

Thank you üôè

## Setup üîß

### - abi.json

- Retrieve the **Contract ABI** for the contract you're looking to monitor, from somewhere like [EtherScan](https://etherscan.io), in JSON format, and include it in `abi.json`.

### - Alchemy

- Create an account at [Alchemy.com](https://alchemy.com) & create a new application on Ethereum mainnet. Once you've created a project, you should be able to grab the API key for it

### - X

- Ensure you have an [X Developer Account](https://developer.twitter.com/), then create a X Developer App (make sure it has both read/write permissions)

- Make sure you are logged in to the X account you want the bot to run on (as the next step will be authorizing the bot to post on your account)

- Install [Twurl](https://github.com/twitter/twurl) and, using your X Developer consumer key & secret, generate the access token & access secret

### - Heroku

- Create a new Heroku account + app (a $7 a month dyno instance should be enough but it'll depend on usage) & set the project as a remote branch of your git repo (see [Heroku Remote](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git#creating-a-heroku-remote))

In the Settings section of your Heroku app you'll see a **Config Vars** section. Add the following config vars:

- **CONSUMER_KEY** - Your X Developer App's Consumer Key
- **CONSUMER_SECRET** - Your X Developer App's Consumer Secret
- **ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY** - The Access Token Key of the X Account your bot is posting from
- **ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET** - The Access Token Secret of the X Account your bot is posting from
- **CONTRACT_ADDRESS** - The contract address you want to monitor sales for
- **ALCHEMY_API_KEY** - Your unique Alchemy API key

Now you're ready to release - just push up the code via. git to the Heroku remote (see [Heroku Remote](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git#creating-a-heroku-remote) if unsure how).

Make sure you are using `worker` dynos and not `web` dynos - you can set this in the CLI your project with:

```sh
heroku ps:scale web=0
heroku ps:scale worker=1
```

## Modification üõ†

In `app.js`, you'll notice there's some commented out logic for only posting sales above a certain `threshold` that you can modify per-currency in `currencies.js`.
